    <h2><strong>Our Mission</strong></h2>
        <p>Many kids at Ronald McDonald Children's Hospital at Loyola University Medical Center would love to have their buckets filled this holiday season. Inspired by a family friend who worked and volunteered at the hospital, Ba'manda, my family (Jeff, Felicia and Katie) and I sought to donate my and my sister's old toys, but came to realize that the hospital could not accept used toys. So, for 12 years we have been collecting and delivering toys (new) and books (new) for the kids at the Ronald McDonald Children's Hospital. Last year we collected enough toys to fill 2+ SUV's; this includes the toys and books we purchased at Building Blocks, a cherished Chicago toy store, with over $5,400 in monetary donations. Our goal last year was to double the previous year's donations. THIS YEAR WE WANT TO DOUBLE LAST YEAR'S DONATIONS! This holiday season you have been given the chance to fill someone's bucket. Why miss it?</p>
