        <p class="misson-text">Many kids at hospitals such as Ronald McDonald Children's Hospital at Loyola University Medical Center would love to have their buckets filled this holiday season. Inspired by a family friend who worked and volunteered at the hospital, Amanda (aka Ba'Manda, the toddler pronunciation), my family (Jeff, Felicia and Katie) and I sought to donate my and my sister's old toys, but came to realize that the hospital could not accept used toys. So, for the past 12 years we have been collecting and delivering toys (new) and books (new) for the kids at the Ronald McDonald Children's Hospital. Last year we collected enough toys to fill 3+ SUV's; this includes the toys and books we purchased at Building Blocks, a cherished Chicago toy store, with over $11,500 in monetary donations. Our goal last year was to double the previous year's donations. We were able to accomplish this because of all the support we got in the past year. Our mission is to get every kid in the hospital a gift this upcoming and future holiday season.</p>

        <p class="doubleDonation">This year we want to help twice as many kids as last year!</p>
